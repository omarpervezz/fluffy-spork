                        <h2 class="section-heading">What is JavaScript?</h2>




                        <p>Initially, JavaScript was created to make web pages interactive.</p>
                        <p>JavaScript has a program called script. The script can be written on an HTML Web page, and it will run automatically when the page is opened in the browser.</p>
                        <p>The script is provided as plain text and executed by the browser. JavaScript doesn't need any Distinctive Readiness or compatibility in order to run the code. It makes JavaScript totally separate from another programming language called Java which is a high-level programming language.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Why did it change from LiveScript to JavaScript?</h2>
                        <p>At first, JavaScript had another name called LiveScript when it was created. At that time Java was extremely widespread. Thus, the decision was made to position a new language as a younger sibling of Java, which would aid in its positioning.</p>
                        <p>Day-by-Day JavaScript became a completely autonomous programming language with ECMAScript specifications. At present, JavaScript has no connection to Java whatsoever.</p>
                        <p>At present, JavaScript isn't restricted to browser environments alone, it's capable of running on servers as well, thanks to the invention of Node.js. It serves as a runtime environment for JavaScript, facilitating its execution outside of web browsers. It uses Chrome V8 engine, Node.js empowers developers to run JavaScript seamlessly on servers.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Each browser engine possesses distinct names:</h2>
                        <p>Here's the name of different engines.</p>
                       <ul>
                        <li><p class="m-0">Chrome uses the V8 engine.</p></li>
                        <li><p class="m-0">Internet Explorer is powered by Chakra.</p></li>
                        <li><p class="m-0">Safari utilizes SquirrelFish.</p></li>
                       </ul>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">Remembering the names of browser engines can be quite helpful. These names used in various developer programs, blog posts, and even video content.</blockquote>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">What is the mechanism of browser engines?</h2>
                        <p>Understanding the workflow of engine processes can be hard, However, the basics remain relatively simple.
                        </p>
                        <p>The browser engines reads the HTML file and interprets the script. Once the scripts are parsed, they are transformed into machine code, and the execution of machine code is quite fast.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">What JavaScript can do within a web browser?</h2>
                        <p>Currently, JavaScript is regarded as a secure programming language. It doesn't grant users direct access to the computer's memory system or the CPU because its original purpose was for browsers that didn't demand it.</p>
                        <p>
                            The abilities of JavaScript are profoundly affected by its context of operation
                            . For Example, in the context of Node.js JavaScript can utilize functions for tasks like reading/writing various files and making network requests.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            JavaScript inside the browser has the ability to manage various responsibilities linked to manipulating webpages, user interaction, and webserver communication. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="fw-bold">For example, JavaScript inside the web browser has the ability to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><p>JavaScript can dynamically modify the content and structure of a webpage. It can add, remove, or change HTML elements, attributes,and adjust the existing styles, allowing for engaging and dynamic user experiences without requiring a full page reload.</p></li>
                            <li><p>JavaScript interact to what users do. It can perform any task with clicks, It can do things when they click, move the mouse, or press keys from the keyboard.</p></li>
                            <li><p>JavaScript can ask other computers to send or get things, like requesting or sharing files. Think of it as having a special chat with other computers.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Collect and set cookies, ask questions to the user, show messages</p></li>
                            <li><p>Keep track of information on the user's device using local storage.
                            </p></li>
                           </ul>
                           <h2 class="section-heading">What JavaScript can't do within a web browser?</h2>
                           <p>The ability of JavaScript has some limits to keep the user's safe. It's designed to prevent bad websites from getting your private info or harming your data.</p>
                           <ul><li><p>JavaScript on a webpage can't read or change files from the computers, copy them, or run programs. It can't directly use operating system.</p></li>
                        <li><p> In JavaScript, you can use the camera, microphone, and other devices, but only if the user says it's okay. So a page with JavaScript can't secretly turn on your webcam, watch things, monitoring you, and send info to anyone else.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Usually, different tabs or windows don't know about one another. At times they have the ability to, such as when one window uses JavaScript to open another. But even then, JavaScript from one page can't look at the other page if they're from different places (like a different website, protocol or address). This is known to as the 'Same Origin Policy.' To with this, both pages need to agree to data exchange and include specific JavaScript code to manage it.</p></li>
                        <li><p>This limitation is once again in place for user safety. A webpage from <b>http://example.com</b> that a user has opened shouldn't be able to reach another browser tab with a URL like <b>http://anotherexample.com</b> and steal information from it, for example.</p></li>
                        <li><p>JavaScript can readily communicate with the server that the current page originated from. However, its capacity to fetch data from external sites or domains is limited. While possible, this demands need a clear arrangement (stated in HTTP headers) from the remote source. Once more, this restriction is in place to ensure user security.</p></li>
                        </ul>
                     <blockquote class="blockquote">
                        Some restrictions do not present when using JavaScript outside of the browser, like on a server, specifically in Node.js. Additionally, Newer browsers support plugins/extensions that might ask for additional permissions.
                     </blockquote>
                     <h2 class="section-heading">What Makes JavaScript Special?</h2>
                     <p>There are minimum of three fantastic elements that make JavaScript remarkably special:</p>
                     <ul><li><p>Seamless integration with HTML/CSS.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Simpler tasks are accomplished easily.</p></li>
                        <li><p>It Works in all browsers and it is turned on by default.</p></li>
                    
                    </ul>
                    <blockquote class="blockquote">JavaScript is the only technology in web browsers that puts these three things together. This is what sets JavaScript apart. That's why it's the top tool for making things on webpages. And remember, JavaScript can also be used for making servers, desktop application,  mobile application and more.</blockquote>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Languages Beyond JavaScript</h2>
                    <p>Everyone are not like the way JavaScript looks. People have different requirements and like different stuff. That's common, because everyone has their individual projects and preferences.
                    </p>
                    <p>So, lately, a bunch of new languages have shown up. These languages get transpiled into JavaScript before they work in the browser.</p>
                    <p>These new tools make changing language fast and easy. This lets developers write in a different language and the transpiler converted them into JavaScript code.</p>
                    <p class="font-weight">
                        Here are some examples of these kinds of languages:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>CoffeeScript: This is like a special version of JavaScript. It uses shorter and clearer instructions, often liked by Ruby developers.</p></li>
                        <li><p>TypeScript: This one is all about making sure the information used is very clear. It's helpful when making complicated systems. People from Microsoft made it.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Flow: Flow also makes sure the information used is clear, but in a different way. Facebook is behind this one.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Dart: This is a different language with its own rules. It can work on things like mobile apps, and it can also be turned into JavaScript. Google made it.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Brython: This changes Python into JavaScript. It lets you write things in just Python without needing JavaScript.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Kotlin: This is a modern and safe programming language. It can work in web browsers or with Node.</p></li>
                 
                    </ul>
                    <blockquote class="blockquote">And there are more. Even if we use one of these changed languages, it's still good to know JavaScript to really understand what's happening.</blockquote>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Wrap-up</h2>
                    <p class="font-400">At first, JavaScript was just for browsers, but now it's used in different places too.
                        Now, JavaScript is the main language for web browsers, working closely with HTML/CSS.
                        There are other languages that turn into JavaScript and give extra features. It's a good idea to check them out, even if you already know JavaScript well.
